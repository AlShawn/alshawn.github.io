I am a fourth year PhD student in the [Machine Learning Department](http://www.ml.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} of the [School of Computer Science](https://www.scs.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"} at [Carnegie Mellon University](http://www.cmu.edu/){:target="_blank"}. My advisor is [Tom Mitchell](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom/){:target="_blank"} and I work on the [Never Ending Language Learning (NELL) system](http://rtw.ml.cmu.edu/rtw/){:target="_blank"}.

My current research revolves around the idea of self-reflection in the context of machine learning. More specifically, I am in the process of developing a framework that will allow learning systems that leverage several different learning mechanisms (i.e. algorithms) to "understand" how well each one of those mechanisms performs in different domains. It will also allow them to improve their learning rate by taking advantage of the "expertise" of each learning mechanism and by directing each such mechanism to learn more efficiently.

Previously I graduated with a MEng in [Electrical and Electronic Engineering](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/electrical-engineering){:target="_blank"} from [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/){:target="_blank"}. For my Master's thesis I proposed a way to use topic modelling methods in order to perform human motion classification. 

I am from Athens, Greece!
